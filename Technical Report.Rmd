Evaluation Criteria:

 Information From Data: Did we learn anything meaningful from this project? Has the original question been answered? Are the chosen analyses appropriate for the variables/relationships under investigation, and are the assumptions underlying these analyses met? Are the analyses carried out correctly? Did the group make appropriate conclusions from the analyses, and are these conclusions justified?

Wrangling: How challenging was the project? Were the data particularly large, complex, and/or messy? Did the data come in an obscure format? Was a scraper or API necessary to acquire the data? Were any elements from outside the coursework necessary to complete the project?


Graphics: How well were the graphical elements of the project designed? Were they clunky or elegant? Was a truly original view of the data presented? Were any interactive elements usable?

Originality/Interest: Is the topic original, interesting, and substantial – or is it trite, pedantic, and trivial? How much creativity, initiative, and ambition did the group demonstrate? Is the basic question driving the project worth investigating, or is it obviously answerable without a data-based study?

) Write-Up: How effectively does the write-up communicate the goals, procedures, and results of the study? Are the claims adequately supported? Does the writing style enhance what the group is trying to communicate? How well is it edited? Are the statistical claims justified? Are text and analyses effectively interwoven? Clear writing, correct spelling, and good grammar are important.

Required for A) Self-Learning: Were any elements from outside the coursework necessary to complete the project?


** we need to establish that when we say events we mean group base location. Also that when a group is created and a hometown is chosen, the latitudes and longitudes are as user specified. Ex) saying your group is in queens along with 100 other people means there will be 101 groups at the same latitude and longitude. That is why our markers overlap!!** In the limitations maybe?



> Abstract: a short, one paragraph explanation of your project. The abstract should be no more than six sentences. It should summarize what you studied and what you found. It need only convey a general sense of what you actually did (not all of the steps and iterations). The purpose of the abstract is to give a prospective reader enough information to decide if they want to read the full paper. A draft of this component of the report will be submitted (see Project summary in Timeline).

Today, seven-in-ten Americans use social media as a tool for engaging with their surrounding communities. The increased use of _____, has created a **vault**/**trove** of data that can be use in the analysis of social trends and habits. This report is an analysis of MeetUp groups in 4 cities along the coast of the United States. Our findings indicate they top events in New York, Charlotte, Boston, and Hartford, and generate a map of these events in each city. 


> Introduction: an overview of your project. In a few paragraphs, you should explain clearly and precisely what your research question is, why it is interesting, and what contribution you have made towards answering that question. You should give an overview of the specifics of your model, but not the full details. Most readers never make it past the introduction, so this is your chance to hook the reader, and is in many ways the most important part of the paper!

Research Question: What are the most popular Meet Up events in various cities along the east coast?

Why its interesting: It is important to understand the social climate of an area when deciding to move to a new city. This is especially important if you have no prior knowledge of **events**, **an area**, **its culture**. 



Our aspirations were sadly cut short due to a several errors with code translation.

Overview of our model: First we scraped live group data from MeetUp's API for 4 cities and saved them on a csv. After merging latitude and longitude data from events and running summary analysis, we imposed groups on a map using the Leaflet package in R.

> Data: a brief description of your data set. What variables are included? Where did they come from? What are units of measurement? What is the population that was sampled? How was the sample collected? You should also include some basic univariate analysis. Here is where you should read in the data, derive new variables, and fit models.

Our data sets are composed of geographical and summary information for each of the 4 cities. Complete definitions of our variables are as follows:

* **city**: the name of the city 
* **group_name**: the name of the group 
* **created**: time the group was created
* **category**: umbrella category groups fall into (dancing, tech)
* **members**: total number of members
* **details**: focus of the group (salsa dancing, robot battling)
* **lat**: latitude of **events**
* **long**: longitude of **events**


Our population is meetup events being created at the time we ran our api call for each city.

Given the variance in group creation



> Results: an explanation of what your model tells me about the research question. You should interpret coefficients in context and explain their relevance. What does your model tell me that I didn’t already know before? You may want to include negative results, but be careful about how you interpret them. For example, you may want to say something along the lines of: “we found no evidence that explanatory variable x is associated with response variable y”, or “explanatory variable x did not provide any additional explanatory power above what was already conveyed by explanatory variable z.” On other hand, you probably shouldn’t claim: “there is no relationship between x and y.”

> Diagnostics: a full diagnostic analysis of your model, with interpretation of Figures that you provide.

> Conclusion: a summary of your findings and a discussion of their limitations. First, remind the reader of the question that you originally set out to answer, and summarize your findings. Second, discuss the limitations of your model, and what could be done to improve it. You might also want to do the same for your data. This is your last opportunity to clarify the scope of your findings before a journalist misinterprets them and makes wild extrapolations! Protect yourself by being clear about what is not implied by your research.

Limitations: Our initial goal was to create a Shiny map that displayed the top events in each city. We intended to have a live pull of Meet Up reservation pull our data from Meet Up's api.
