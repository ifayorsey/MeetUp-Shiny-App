#Meetup Map

> Purpose

For our project we plan on analyzing RSVP data provided by Meetup. Meetup is a social networking app that engages people with organizations and events around them. The question is what are the relations we share that bring each other together the most? We plan on merging this data with information on population density to correct for population bias in the sample. Essentially, we think that meetup events and attendance correlates with population, so we want to normalize the population in different areas. Are certain places better for music meetups, dance meetups, board game meet ups?  How are strangers connecting in the 21st century? Does this depend on place?


> Data 

Our raw data is a streaming list of RVSP's made per minute on the app. The stream contains and individuals username, the organization they are meeting up with, and what city the event takes place in. We plan on interacting with this stream through Meetup's API. Since this a json structured API, we plan on tranlating the data into R objects with jsonlite package. In our minds, the process is simliar to the sql workbench examples. We can use the API to generate a table as RSVP's are made, and "nest" that code into a jsonlite function like dbGetQuery so it runs in R. 
 
 
* Meetup RVSP Stream: <http://meetup.github.io/stream/rsvpTicker/>
* API Documentation <https://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/docs/stream/2/rsvps/?_cookie-check=weINBfhFXdo7jjrN#websockets>


> Variables: 

The variables included in the API that we find interesting are as follows:

* event_time: gives the time of the event
* event_city: city name 
* event_country:two-letter code of group's home country
venue
* lat: latitude of the venue
* lon: longitude of the venue 
* group_topics: topics associated with this group
* guests: number of guests at the event
* population of city: population of city (possibly with 10 mile radius)
* percent population and /or standardized attendance: the percent of the city attendance of the event 

The API that we can get these variables from includes "find groups" and then we can loop through all the groups to get the events that each group holds. 

> End Product:

We hope to deliver a Shiny application with a map of the US or of the world with interesting findings as to what type of meetups are most frequented in each place. This should provide a visual representation of the hubs for different meetups around the world by group topic.  We would like to see what types of activities most people like to meet up with strangers to do.
